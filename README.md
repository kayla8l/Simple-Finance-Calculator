# simple-finance-calculator

This calculator will find the current stock price using a company's next dividend and return on equity. 

Dividend growth will also be considered.

If the calculated stock price > current stock price, BUY THE STOCK! (it is undervalued)

If the calculated stock price < current stock price, DON'T BUY THE STOCK! (it is overvalued)

Happy investing!
